# Sketch-Based Content Retrieval System

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Sketch-Based Content Retrieval System, an innovative search engine that allows users to use sketches to search for relevant content within a digital database. It is designed to interpret the attributes of the sketched input and provide results such as PDF documents, 3D models, and detailed text descriptions that closely match the sketch.

## Features

- **Sketch Recognition**: Implementing advanced algorithms to analyze the sketch and extract searchable attributes.
- **Content Matching**: Sophisticated search functionality that finds and ranks content based on its relevance to the sketched attributes.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Compatibility with a variety of content formats, including PDFs, 3D model files, and text documents.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to upload sketches and view results.
- **Scalable Database**: A robust and scalable database that can handle a large number of entries and a variety of content types.
